            Hey! My name is Jesse Allen Cooke.
            <br><br>
            My journey begins with an interest in art from a very young age that soon manifested in the form of graffiti by middle school and carried through my first years at college. In 8th grade I had the opportunity to write myself a letter to open up when I was a senior in high school. This letter included some funny questions and statements but the most important part was where I had written what I wanted to do for a living: become a graphic designer.
            <br><br>
            By the start of my senior year of high school, I was already spending my days sketching and nights on Photoshop and had been accepted to attend The Art Institutes International Minnesota in Minneapolis to get my B.S. in Graphic Design.
            <br><br>
            My years in college were magical (even though I didn't realize it at the time..). I dedicated this time in my life to becoming an exceptional designer at all costs necessary. It didn't matter how much time I had to put in or what new things I had to learn—I'd do it if it meant getting closer to my goal of being a successful designer.
            <br><br>
            I freelanced for most of this time in college while also working nights at UPS. Eventually, going into my senior year of college, I picked up an internship at Morsekode. This internship soon turned into a part-time job while in school and then a full-time job the day I graduated. I learned so much in my time there—not just about design and the creative fields, but about being an adult, working with others, and leaving my ego at home.
            <br><br>
            Coming up on a year at <a href="https://morsekode.com/" target="_blank">Morsekode</a>, my fiance Jess and I had our first child; Halsey Jo. This ultimately resulted in a decision to move back home to Proctor, just outside Duluth, MN.
            <br><br>
            Since January 8th, 2018, I've been working hard as an Email Developer at <a href="https://www.maurices.com/" target="_blank">maurices corporate</a> by day and running <a href="https://www.pixlhaus.design/" target="_blank">Pixl Haus</a> by night. Throughout the past year and a half I've become more interested in front-end development and have shifted my time and efforts towards the never-ending practice of coding.
